# FerreSasSProject

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.13.

## HTTP client & authentication interceptor

All HTTP calls go through the shared `ApiService`, which prefixes requests with the value of `environment.apiBaseUrl` (default `http://localhost:8081/ferrisys-service`). The `AuthInterceptor` automatically injects the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for every request except the authentication endpoints (`/v1/auth/login` and `/v1/auth/register`).

To keep the session active make sure the login flow stores the JWT token in `sessionStorage` (or `localStorage`). The interceptor reads from `sessionStorage` first and falls back to `localStorage` when present.

When you need to call a protected endpoint, inject `ApiService` in your Angular service/component and use the `get`, `post`, `put` or `delete` helpers. Example:

```ts
import { ApiService } from './core/services/api.service';

constructor(private readonly api: ApiService) {}

loadProducts() {
  return this.api.get('/v1/inventory/products');
}
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
